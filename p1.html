			<h1>Project</h1>
				<section>
				<hr>
				<p>
				The project we are proposing is a Pet Adoption Website.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The website will provide a page listing all animals that are available for adoption, 
				as well as information and pictures of each animal. The system would be 
				used by people of all ages that would be interested in adopting a pet, 
				and will direct them to the proper connections to get the adoption 
				process started.

			<h1>User Research</h1>
				<section>
				<hr>
				<p>
				We choose to use the survey and secondary research methods for our project. The survey will give us feedback 
				about what people think about adoption and what they need if they want to adopt a pet. It will teach us 
				what information should be included in our website. Since there some websites that exist already, we opted to
				use secondary research explore them and identify some problems they have that could help improve our own design. 
				</p>		

				<h2>Survey</h2>

				<h3>Survey Results: </h3>
					
				<p>
				Acquiring information using surveys was vitally important to completing our understanding and making 
				sure that we werenâ€™t coming into any bias. Our survey received 28 responses and was mostly sent to 
				friends who graciously took the time to answer it. 
				</p>
					
				<p>
				What we found was that half of the people would be interested in using a pet adoption service and that 
				the vast majority of people would prefer to use a website or an in store adoption service.  
				</p>
					
				<p>
				Our survey demographics showed a good balance as almost half of the people have never owned a pet while 
				half had already did. When it came to adopting a pet, the most important factors were the size, 
				activity level and age of the pet. Species was not that important a factor. 
				</p>
					
				<p>
				In regards to the adoption process, there was a vast importance to interact with the pet before 
				adopting it, with the desire to schedule an appointment with the pet to being an extremely important 
				feature. 
				</p>
					
				<p>
				Among the people interviewed, there was very low familiarity of the pet adoption process, with 80% of 
				people surveyed having a familiarity of 3 or lower. Many of them wanted to see tips on adoption, so 
				making sure that the website provided information was important. Many people (81.5%) also wanted links 
				to popular resources on adoption.
				</p>
					
				<p>
				As for the inclusion of a live chat feature, half of the  people were on the fence as to whether they 
				would want it.
				</p>
