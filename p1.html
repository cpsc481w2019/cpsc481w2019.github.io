			<h1>Project</h1>
				<section>
				<hr>
				<p class="tab">
				The project we are proposing is a Pet Adoption Website.
				</p>
				
				<p class="tab">
				The website will provide a page listing all animals that are available for adoption, 
				as well as information and pictures of each animal. The system would be 
				used by people of all ages that would be interested in adopting a pet, 
				and will direct them to the proper connections to get the adoption 
				process started.

			<h1>User Research</h1>
				<section>
				<hr>
				<p class="tab">
				We chose to use the survey and secondary research methods for our project. The survey will give us feedback 
				about what people think about adoption and what they need if they want to adopt a pet. It will teach us 
				what information should be included in our website. Since there some websites that exist already, we opted to
				use secondary research explore them and identify some strengths and weaknesses they have that could help improve
				our own design. 
				</p>		

				<h2>Survey</h2>
					
				<h4><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8xYzTQbBeGd0l59lFNl9xC_5JMzxulwyrNa7QFD6j-WDNtQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">Survey questions link</a></h4>
					
				<h4><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8xYzTQbBeGd0l59lFNl9xC_5JMzxulwyrNa7QFD6j-WDNtQ/viewanalytics" target="_blank">Survey responses link</a>
					
				<h3>Survey Results: </h3>
					
				<p class="tab">
				Acquiring information using surveys was vitally important to completing our understanding and making 
				sure that we weren’t coming into any bias. Our survey received 28 responses and was mostly sent to 
				friends who graciously took the time to answer it. 
				</p>
					
				<p class="tab">
				What we found was that half of the people would be interested in using a pet adoption service and that 
				the vast majority of people would prefer to use a website or an in store adoption service.  
				</p>
					
				<p class="tab">
				Our survey demographics showed a good balance as almost half of the people have never owned a pet while 
				half had already did. When it came to adopting a pet, the most important factors were the size, 
				activity level and age of the pet. Species was not that important a factor. 
				</p>
					
				<p class="tab">
				In regards to the adoption process, there was a vast importance to interact with the pet before 
				adopting it, with the desire to schedule an appointment with the pet to being an extremely important 
				feature. 
				</p>
					
				<p class="tab">
				Among the people interviewed, there was very low familiarity of the pet adoption process, with 80% of 
				people surveyed having a familiarity of 3 or lower. Many of them wanted to see tips on adoption, so 
				making sure that the website provided information was important. Many people (81.5%) also wanted links 
				to popular resources on adoption.
				</p>
					
				<p class="tab">
				As for the inclusion of a live chat feature, half of the  people were on the fence as to whether they 
				would want it.
				</p>
					
				<h2>Secondary research</h2>
					
				<p class="tab">
				For our secondary research, we analyzed two different adoption services that are currently available. 
				One of them is Calgary Humane Society’s website and another service that operates in Canada and the 
				United States called Petango. Calgary Humane Society, to put it briefly, it an organization that 
				shelters animals who don’t have a place to call home and set them up for adoption for people who are 
				willing to take them in. Petango by contrast, is several adoption agencies listing their animals 
				on the site, giving users some amount of choice on where they will adopt from.
				</p>

				<h4><a href="https://www.calgaryhumane.ca/" target="_blank">Resource website 1: Calgary Humane Society</a></h4>
					
				<p class="tab">
				First of all let’s begin with Calgary Humane Society’s (referred to as CHS henceforth) implementation 
				of their adoption service. Some of the aspects that CHS does well is give you resources that will help 
				guide you on how to take care of a pet after you adopt them, such as the budget that you will have to 
				consider when taking care of a pet. However, this is the only information that they provide upfront and 
				access to the information is not immediate, but does appear very visibly on the side when you are in 
				the adoption section of the website. Another thing that CHS does well is that they provide as much 
				background on the animal that you are considering to adopt as they can. When you click of an animal of 
				interest, they give you information such as age, breed, size, and a short biography to humanize the 
				animals along with some more pictures and sometimes a video. This information though, is displayed on 
				a seperate window that opens up rather than a new tab or a window within the site, increasing the 
				overall clutter on the screen. A solution to this would be display a card that displays on the window 
				you are currently on that you can exit out of and continue looking at the other available animals there 
				are.
				</p>
					
				<p class="tab">
				There are also several aspects that CHS could improve upon. The overall layout of the website feels 
				very cluttered and outdated causing some confusion when navigating around the site. When you hover on 
				the top menu and go into the “Adopt” submenu, it you can’t click on the pictures to go next page, but 
				you have to click the small “Meet our dogs” text underneath the image to go to the dog adoption page. 
				This makes it a bit confusing and wastes time when trying to get to that page. Another aspect that CHS 
				could improve on is to make the adoption policy much more visible as that should be the most important 
				thing to consider before adopting. Also, when you are looking at an animal in their catalogue, there is 
				no way to adopt the specific pet you are viewing from that page. There are features of any live 
				information of the pets and no live chat. There is somewhat limited information on the long term care 
				of an adopted animal, any addition of that would be very helpful for people who finally go through with 
				an adoption. On the quick adoption form there is some vagueness with animal characteristics, such as 
				the case we found with us not having a clear idea what “medium energy” means exactly. On the page where 
				it lists the addresses of all the available locations, it could be useful to display them on a map of 
				some kind, such as Google Maps. Finally, there is no way to set up an account, which could give people 
				the chance to read over the adoption policy prior to signing in.
				</p>
					
				<h4><a href="https://www.petango.com/" target="_blank">Resource website 2: Petango.com Online Pet Adoption</a></h4>
				
				<p class="tab">
				There are several thing that Petango does well. First of all, their search is very good as it is able 
				to cover the whole of Canada and the United States and can be as precise as the location of your 
				postal/ZIP code. You also also increase the search radius from your location to help the user find more 
				choices if they are willing to go the distance, or if there is nothing that they are looking for in 
				their immediate vicinity. The search can search down to the specific breed of a cat or dog, with the 
				exception of the “Other” category. For more advances users, there is a specific “advanced search” 
				option which gives you many options to help narrow down the exact animal you are looking for. There are 
				also several resources on the long term care for your pet in their “Care Center” section. A network to 
				help locate lost pets is also available within the site, along with some helpful tips on how to locate 
				animals easier and suggestions on how to make them easier to track if they do get lost. There is also 
				an option to create an account on the site. The overall layout of the website is much more simpler 
				compared to CHS’s website, but even it could use some improvements as well. 
				</p>
					
				<p class="tab">
				Some things Pentago could improve on is to add a live chat feature so that adopters can more easily
				interact and communicate with other users who have their animals set up for adoption. Also another 
				thing that has been noticed is that the website is also being used by different animal shelters who 
				are partners with the service, so it could cause some confusion when adopting some animals since they 
				could come from different locations. All the contact information is visible on the side at the top, but 
				they aren’t any forms of instant communication besides calling the phone number of the specified 
				location. A lot of animals don’t have their pictures available, but that is more due to the shelter’s 
				not providing them rather than Petango not having any. So to improve upon they, they should make it 
				required to have a picture of the animal that is being set up for adoption. 
				</p>
				
				<h2>Reflection of methods</h2>
				
				<p class="tab">
				While we are content with our research done, there are numerous improvements we believe we could 
				have done to develop our findings more thoroughly. 
				</p>
					
				<p class="tab">
				We are content with the length of our survey which was able to be completed quickly. None of the 
				recipients complained about the length which has happened before in other projects. We accomplished 
				this by having the majority of the survey be close ended questions which were easy to answer.
				</p>
					
				<p class="tab">
				We should have added more open ended questions, as this provides a lot of feedback and considerations 
				we might not have thought of before. Our survey was very quick to take, so adding in longer questions 
				wouldn’t have detracted from the fatigue of the process.
				</p>
					
				<p class="tab">
				Furthermore, having a more diverse demographic would be better representative of our user base. 
				Since many older adults adopt pets, it would be useful to get their insight onto the process since the 
				vast majority of our surveyed demographic were our friends who thus would have similar life experiences 
				to our own. 
				</p>
					
				<p class="tab">
				Doing secondary research gives us an overview of how the adoption websites work. Based on this 
				experience, we find what should be included and what could be improved in this system. This method goes 
				helps fill any holes that the survey leaves open and ties our findings from it together.

				<h4>Task example 1: Dave</h4>
					
				<ol>
					<li>Dave is a recent university graduate who wants to adopt a pet now that he lives alone. </li>
					<li>He has no idea how to begin this process, so he looks for information on the website about essential resources needed to take care of a pet. </li>
					<li>He decides he wants a dog, so he clicks on the picture of a dog he really wants and goes through the process to adopt it. </li>
					<li>He meets with the dog in one of the locations and decides he loves him so much he complete his adoption process. </li>
				</ol>
					
					
				<h4>Task example 2: Lisa</h4>
					
				<ol>
					<li>Lisa is a skilled pet owner. Recently, her dog Jane has given birth to pups and she wants to put some of them up for adoption. </li>
					<li>She goes on the website and finds a place where she can put her pets up for adoption. </li>
					<li>She clicks on the page to put up pets for adoption. She can successfully complete the paper form and puts her dogs for adoption, which immediately are able to go through the system for other uses to see. </li>
				</ol>

					
				<h4>Task example 3: Mike</h4>
					
				<ol>
					<li>Mike is a caretaker who works at a local shelter. He takes care of a multitude of pets. Recently a new iguana named Ike has just arrived and he needs to upload Ike’s information onto to the service. </li>
					<li>He goes on the website and logs in as a special account. Within the website, he can go and upload a new pet that has arrived at their shelter locally. </li>
				</ol>

					
				<h4>Task example 4: Sara</h4>
					
				<ol>
					<li>Sara is a young girl (not old enough to adopt on her own yet) but is curious about the process of adoption and wants to look at pictures of cute animals. </li>
					<li>She goes onto the service and checks the galleries for pictures of cute pets. While there, she notices a picture of a very cute cat that she would like to adopt in the future. </li>
					<li>She becomes interested in cats and begins going through our information section to look at the process of adopting and taking care of a cat. </li>
				</ol>
					
					
				<h4>Task example 5: Calvin</h4>
					
				<ol>
					<li>Calvin is the administrator of a shelter and has recently gotten an influx of  adoption requests. He wants to help update information about his shelter and also review the requests he’s received. </li>
					<li>He begins by logging onto his administrative account. From there, he is able to go onto his shelter’s information page and modify details such as their description and adoption policies. </li>
					<li>He then goes onto his review section so he can check out the application and either accept or reject adoption requests based on the information he’s given. </li>
				</ol>
					
					
				<h4>Task example 6: Kyle</h4>
					
				<ol>
					<li>Kyle is an experienced pet owner. He’s adopted numerous rabbits before and wants to take care of another. </li>
					<li>He wants to find one close to him, so he uses the filter system to filter for rabbits as well as a shelter that is close to him.  He’s already adopted many pets before, so he knows all about rabbits as well, and he doesn’t really need to schedule an appointment beforehand. </li>
					<li>He fills out the form to adopt the rabbit and after his process is complete, he takes his new friend home with him. </li>
				</ol>
