			<h1>Project</h1>
				<section>
				<hr>
				<p>
				The project we are proposing is a Pet Adoption Website.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The website will provide a page listing animals available for adoption, 
				as well as information and pictures of each animal. The system would be 
				used by people of all ages that would be interested in adopting a pet, 
				and will direct them to the proper connections to get the adoption 
				process started.
