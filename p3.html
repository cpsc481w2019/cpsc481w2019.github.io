					<h4>1. Visibility of system status</h4>	
					<ol>
						<li>News page features articles that scroll/change, however there is no indication that this is the case.User has to wait an indeterminate time for the article to change. The rate at which the articles switch seems very inconsistent. Some articles change over faster than others. (SR: 2)</li>
						<li>Using the search your EpicName function on the top right, there is no system information given about whether it has found the EpicName or not. There is no updates given to the user. (SR: 2)</li>
						<li>The page will record the user name after user enter it, but some capitalization would be changed. (SR: 4)
							<br>Ex. 1
							<br>
							<img src="/he_images/1_3_1.jpg" alt="1_3_1">
							<img src="/he_images/1_3_2.jpg" alt="1_3_2">
						
							<br>Ex. 2
							<br>
							<img src="/he_images/1_3_3.png" alt="1_3_3">
							<img src="/he_images/1_3_4.png" alt="1_3_4">
						</li>
					</ol>
					
					
					<h4>2. Match between system and the real world</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>None. </li>
					</ol>
					
					
					<h4>3. User control and freedom</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>No method of changing the news articles. Recommendation: arrows on the left and right side of the page or a horizontal scroll bar. (SR: 2)</li>
					</ol>
					
					
					<h4>4. Consistency and standards</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Capitalization of words and categories not consistent. (SR: 1)
							<br>
							<img src="/he_images/4_1_1.png" alt="4_1_1">
							<img src="/he_images/4_1_2.png" alt="4_1_2">
							</li>
					
						<li>Categories for weapons is not consistent, assault rifles are grouped together but sniper rifles are not. (SR: 3)</li>

						<li>Some names and pictures are the same in “Items” and “Skins” which seems they are the same skin but showed in different place. This may confused users why needs two pages to show items and skins when skins are all included in items. (SR: 2)</li>

						<li>The “user name” in the main page is the same meaning of the “Epic name” on top right of all pages. Use two different names could confused users. (SR: 1)</li>
					
						<li>When you go to the weapons tab, when you click the rarity, it gives you all the weapons of that rarity. However, when you select a type of weapon you want to view in that rarity, it shows all the weapons instead of all the weapons of that rarity - Rating 3
							<br>
							<img src="/he_images/4_5.png" alt="4_5">
						</li>
					</ol>

				
					<h4>5. Error prevention</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>There is nothing that prevents the user from making errors since the system itself does not recognize any errors. For example, the filter option when browsing skin type to weapon type, the system does not recognize that it is displaying the wrong information. (SR: 3)</li>
					</ol>
					
					
					<h4>6. Recognition rather than recall</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Initially not intuitive that headers in the All Items table are sortable. (SR: 1)</li>
					</ol>
					
					
					<h4>7. Flexibility and efficiency of use</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>No search option for items/skins/weapons. (SR: 2)</li>
						<li>No filter for skins. (SR: 1)</li>
						<li>Filter for weapons does not work properly. For example, if selecting Rare and Suppressed Submachine Gun, it will display all suppressed submachine guns, not just the rare ones. See figure below. (SR: 4)
							<br>
							<img src="/he_images/7_3.png" alt="7_3">
						</li>
					</ol>
					
					
					<h4>8. Aesthetic and minimalist design</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Past Matches page displays a lot of matches. Recommendation: Initially only show the past 10 matches and have an option to “display more” to reduce clutter. (SR: 1)</li>
						<li>Skins page is large and cluttered due to displaying all skins. Recommendation: Toggle button to view all skins instead of outright displaying them all. (SR: 1)</li>
						<li>Assault rifles in the filter represent a group but can be confused as a singular type of a weapon. Recommend separating categories or indenting the subcategories for more clarity. (SR: 2)</li>
					</ol>
						
					
					<h4>9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>There does not exist any form of help from users to recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. No information page or notifications are given. For example, when user enter a wrong user name, there is no error message or any other notification to give. (SR: 2)</li>
					</ol>
					
					
					<h4>10. Help and documentation</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>There does not exist any documentation or help page that gives information to the user. (SR: 1)</li>
					</ol>
