				<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <section>
        <p class="tab">
        Pet adoption can be a difficult and arduous process. To that end, we developed the design for Pettr, an easy to use pet 
        adoption website with a multitude of features that will make pet adoption easy. Pettr allows you go through a database of 
        pets from shelters all around a local area and schedule to meet and adopt it. The website also provides information for 
        adopting a pet, to better help the user find the pet that is perfect for them.
        </p>
        </section>
        
        
        <h2>Design Problem</h2>
        <section>
        <p class="tab">
        Our goal was to simplify and help people to be able to adopt pets easily and provide them with the necessary information to be 
        a well-informed owner. Many adoption sites are slow and cluttered and did not provide a clean interface to be able to search 
        and find a pet that a user would want to adopt. Furthermore, there aren’t easy options to book meetings with a pet. Websites 
        such as the Calgary Humane Society do not have a unified system, as certain features were forced to use a different website 
        such as petango.com to handle the adoption process.
        </p>
        </section>
    
    
        <h2>User Reseach and Findings</h2>
        <section>
        <p class="tab">
        In order to acquire more information, we utilized surveys and individual research to find out more about our design problem.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
        Acquiring information using surveys was vitally important to completing our understanding and making sure that we weren’t 
        coming into any bias. Our survey received 28 responses and was mostly sent to friends who graciously took the time to answer it.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
        What we found was that half of the people would be interested in using a pet adoption service and that the vast majority of 
        people would prefer to use a website or an in store adoption service.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
        Our survey demographics showed a good balance as almost half of the people have never owned a pet while half had already did. 
        When it came to adopting a pet, the most important factors were the size, activity level and age of the pet. Species was not 
        that important a factor.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
        In regards to the adoption process, there was a vast importance to interact with the pet before adopting it, with the desire 
        to schedule an appointment with the pet to being an extremely important feature.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
        Among the people interviewed, there was very low familiarity of the pet adoption process, with 80% of people surveyed having a 
        familiarity of 3 or lower. Many of them wanted to see tips on adoption, so making sure that the website provided information 
        was important. Many people (81.5%) also wanted links to popular resources on adoption.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
        As for the inclusion of a live chat feature, half of the people were on the fence as to whether they would want it.
        </p>
        </section>


        <h2>Design and Justification</h2>
        <section>
        <h3>Lofi-Prototype</h3>
        <p class="tab">
        For our lofi prototype, we began with how we wanted our website to flow. One of our biggest issues with websites such as the 
        Calgary Humane Society were that it took way too long to be able to search for the pets you wanted to adopt, therefore, we made 
        the pet database a one-click  in our side bar menu, along with a representative paw icon so that it would be visually pleasing 
        and easy to spot.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
        If the user wanted information on how to adopt a pet, adoption information is a key part of the side bar and provides a helpful 
        selection of links to whatever topic the user would be curious about.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
        For our pet information page, while many websites provided pictures and a few basic details about a pet, there was nothing on 
        these pages to filter or search for the type of pets. We fixed this issues by adding drop down menus and a search bar, to allow 
        for quick navigation to the pets you want. When you click on a pet profile, you will be provided with a full list of 
        information about the pet, as well as options to contact and adopt the pet. This creates a streamlined process for adoption 
        that was missing from certain pet adoption websites.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
        The website also was designed to be easy to use on the administrative end. For shelters and caretakers, they can login into a 
        shelter administrative account where they can search through all their pets at their database and remove postings or edit 
        information. This allows shelters the ability to quickly manage their pets without the need to contact website administrators.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Hifi-Prototype</h3>
        <p class="tab">
        For our hifi prototype, we developed our initial ideas from our lofi-prototype. We decided upon green as a primary color to 
        use, as it stands out from many websites and the green color itself would be symbolic of nature and the wild.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
        Our home page contains selection of newest pets to help them to be adopted quickly, as well as our newsletter which can help 
        provide adoption news as well as important information about adoption and taking care of pets. Our different news stories are 
        categorized in the top right corner, allowing the user to quickly filter different types of stories through search.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
        Our hifi-prototype introduced our website footer, which is consistent among all the pages. This footer provides quick links 
        to our about us and contact page, as well as links to our social media if they are interested in learning about changes to the 
        website as well as promote Pettr.
        </p>
        </section>
        
        
        <h2>Heuristic Evaluation and Findings</h2>
        <section>
        <h3>Filters</h3>
        <p class="tab">
        As the Heuristic Evaluation reported, some filters missed in home page and pet information page. We added a category filter for homepage 
        articles so that user could focus on the topic they are interested in. We also added size as a filter in pet information page 
        since it is an important point when people want to adopt a pet. We think we could include more filters for the pets in the 
        future. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Verification and Confirmation</h3>
        <p class="tab">
        In original design, we missed verification and confirmation in our website. For the safety, we decide to add them. One is in 
        the process of apply to adopt. After user filled in their information, they should confirm it again before they actually 
        submit. Email verification is also added in both adopt application form and when admin want to change email. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Consistency</h3>
        <p class="tab">
        User could be confused about the email address in our contact page because the official Twitter and Youtube account name has 
        “official” but not in email address. We decide to change the email address to “petadoptionofficial@petadoption.com” which is 
        the same form as other account. 
        </p>
        </section>
        
        
        <h2>Usability Testing and Findings</h2>
        <section>
        </section>
        
        
        <h2>Recommendations for Next Iteration</h2>
        <section>
        <h3>Volunteers</h3>
        <p class="tab">
        An addition to the next iteration of our design could be to add a “Volunteers” section, where adoption agencies can advertise 
        their volunteer postings so interested individuals can easily sign up for volunteer opportunities.This section would list the 
        agency posting the position, description of the duties, and the dates they are looking for volunteers.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Videos</h3>
        <p class="tab">
        Adding videos of the pet available for adoption could add more detail to the listing and provides prospective adopters a better 
        look and feel for the animal, rather than only displaying photos of the animal. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Dynamic Header</h3>
        <p class="tab">
        Instead of a static photo for the header, a dynamic header that changes images could be more appealing. This could allow header 
        images to be related to upcoming events, and could be clickable so that when the user sees the header showing the title of an 
        event they are interested in then they can click on it and access the details of that event easily.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Footer Site Map</h3>
        <p class="tab">
        For better ease of use, a site map located in the footer of the website would be helpful. When users cannot find what they are 
        looking for in the header or body of the website then a site map becomes a useful tool for navigation. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Adaptable View</h3>
